The presented PBPK model of tizanidine has been developed to be used in a PBPK Drug-Drug-Interactions (DDI) network with tizanidine as a substrate of CYP1A2.

Tizanidine is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant generally used for the symptomatic treatment of acute painful muscle spasms and chronic spasticity resulting from diverse neurologic disorders ([Granfors 2004](#5-References)).

**Absorption**: After oral administration of tizanidine-HCl it is absorbed fast and completely with peak plasma concentrations reached within 1 hour. Administration of tizanidine together with food increases plasma concentrations. The influence of food on the concentration-time profile is also dependent on the formulation. A capsule given with food leads to a prolonged Tmax, with a Cmax slightly lower than when the drug is given without food. In contrast, giving the tablet with food leads to higher peak concentrations while Tmax remains unchanged.

**Distribution**: Approximately 30% is bound to plasma proteins. The concentration-time profile elicits a monophasic shape.

**Metabolism**: Over 95% of a dose is metabolized. The main enzyme system involved in the metabolism of tizanidine is CYP1A2.

**Excretion**: Only a minor part of the dose is recovered unchanged in the urine <5%.
