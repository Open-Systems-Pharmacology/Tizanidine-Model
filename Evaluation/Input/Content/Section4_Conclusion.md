The PBPK model developed for tizanidine accurately predicts the time-profiles following single and multiple dosing of tizanidine. Population simulations show that predicted PK variability is in accordance with the literature.

The renal elimination is limited to glomerular filtration only. The predicted small fraction eliminated in Urine (~1%) is in line with literature reports (<5%). Given the minor contribution of the renal pathway no further exploration of active secretion was considered as the impact on DDI predictions is likely small.

Observed data suggests that administration of food accelerates the dissolution of tizanidine tablets, which is modeled through a separate set of parameter values. The effect of food on the capsule could not be described well in terms of peak concentrations. DDI predictions should be restricted to the tablet formulation. The fa estimated by PK-Sim was 1.0 in both fed and fasted condition, indicating that fa was not the limiting factor in this model.

As the model was developed in non-smoking subjects, it cannot be used to predict tizanidine concentrations in smokers.
