# Tizanidine-Model
Whole-body PBPK model of tizanidine as a substrate of CYP1A2

This repository contains:

- a PK-Sim snapshot (*.json) file of the current PBPK model
- static content (e.g. text blocks, *.md files) as inputs for an evaluation plan
- an evaluation plan (evaluation-plan.json) to create an evaluation report using the snapshot and static text blocks to display the performance of the model

**The latest release of the snapshot of the model, the evaluation plan and the static content can be found [here](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Tizanidine-Model/releases/latest).**

**The latest release of the PK-Sim project model file and the respective evaluation report can be found [here](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSP-PBPK-Model-Library/releases/latest).**


The presented PBPK model of tizanidine has been developed to be used in a PBPK Drug-DrugInteractions (DDI) network with tizanidine as a substrate of CYP1A2. The development of this model is described in the publication by Kanacher *et al.* [[1](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Ethinylestradiol-Model#references)]
